<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Jackie Palmer. I have made this about me page more times
    than I'd like to admit, but here's to hoping this is the one. I am a
    senior at Duke University, majoring in psychology, minoring in education, 
    and currently on the pre-health track. I am interested in public pre-health
    and reproductive justice. I also love to dance, listen to music, sing,
    watch tv and movies, and spend time with friends, whether that's just 
    talking on the phone or spending quality time in person.
