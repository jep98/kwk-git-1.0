<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>My name is Jackie Palmer. I have made this about me page more times
    than I'd like to admit, but here's to hoping this is the one. I am a
    senior at Duke University, majoring in psychology, minoring in education, 
    and currently on the pre-health track. I am interested in public pre-health
    and reproductive justice. I also love to dance, listen to music, sing,
    watch tv and movies, and spend time with friends, whether that's just 
    talking on the phone or spending quality time in person.

    <p>*I just started watching these compilations on Youtube, but the stories are really interesting
        and sometimes sick to watch unfold, especially as someone working in customer service in a 
        different capacity.

    <h3>My KWK/Coding Journey</h3>
    <p>My coding journey actually <i><strong>started</strong></i>
    with Kode with Klossy! I did a KWK camp during COVID, and that's 
    when I first got started with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS,</p>
    <p>I then took a JavaScript programming class in high school!</p>
    <p>I took a break from coding, but revisited it in college when I took
        an Algorithms class, teaching us some intermediate skills in JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>I also did a little coding in R in a statistics class in college!</p>
    <p>....and now, I'm here! Refreshing coding skills once again and trying to angle them towards
        data.
